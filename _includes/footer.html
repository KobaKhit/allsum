To offer You meaningful products and services and for the reasons set forth in this policy, We collect information about you, including Personally Identifiable Information, from the following sources: 
Information We Collect Directly from You: The type of information that we collect directly from you varies based on your interaction with our Site and our Services.

Allsumm™ may request other information from You during or after the registration process that Allsumm™ uses to provide better and more customized services to Users. You acknowledge that this information is personal to You, and by creating an account on Allsumm™, You may allow others, including Allsumm™, to identify You and to allow Allsumm™ to use Your information in accordance with the Terms. 
                     Customer Service
We collect information when You interact with Allsumm’s customer service in order to accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and investigate breaches of Our terms. 
Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites
Information You provide to third-party sites/websites through the Service are not within the control of Allsumm™ and You provide such information at Your own risk. The terms and conditions of use and the privacy policies of those websites that You provide information to through the Service will govern their use of such information. Any information You share with a third-party site through the Service will be collected by Allsumm™. Allsumm™ will use such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. 
Information Collected Automatically
Use of Cookies. The Site may send a cookie to Your computer. Cookies allow us to recognize You as a user when You return to the Allsumm™ website using the same computer and web browser and to monitor how you use the Site. We use cookies to identify which areas of Our site You have visited, so the next time You visit the site, those pages may be readily accessible. We also may use this information to better personalize the content that You see on the Site. We also use cookies to automatically capture activity on the Site, such as where You click, how You scroll through the Site, or what fields you enter text into (without seeing the actual text you enter). Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. However, if You reject Our Cookies, certain functionality on the Site may not work correctly or at all. 
We may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Allsumm™ does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies. 
If You send us notice that you object to our use of cookies, a “disagree” cookie will be stored in your browser and Allsumm™ will not collect any session data. You can object to the collection and analysis of this anonymous data by emailing Your request to opt out to allinfo@allsumm.com. 
Web Beacons
Allsumm™ also may use web beacons, pixels, anonymous ad network tags, and cookies to collect information about Your use of the Site and the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, to collect anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers, and to collect data related to Your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information collected by Web Beacons also allows us to statistically monitor how many people open Our emails and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web Beacons are not used to track Your activity outside of the Site or the websites of Our sponsors. However, because Your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if You had requested a web page from their site. If You are a non-registered Visitor to the Site, the only information We collect will be Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons. 
Log files, IP Addresses and information about Your computer and mobile device
Due to the communications standards on the internet, when You visit the Site We automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site to which You are going when You leave Allsumm’s Site. Allsumm™ also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of Your computer (or the proxy server You use to access the World Wide Web), Your computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns, Your mobile device (including Your UDID or Vendor Identification) and mobile operating system (if You are accessing the Site using a mobile device), as well as the name of Your ISP or Your mobile carrier. Allsumm™ may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that You have enabled. Also, as described above in Section 1.D. Allsumm™ receives information when You access third-party web pages through the Service. The link between Your IP address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without Your permission, except as described in Section 8. ("When We May Disclose Your Information"), below. 
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this Privacy Policy (e.g., by disabling cookies, or using ‘private’ browsing modes). 
Exemptions from Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may send to Allsumm™ by email or instant messaging programs (i.e. AOL, Yahoo, etc.), as email and instant messages are not recognized as secure communication forms. As such, We request that You do not send any information, which You consider private, to us by email or instant message. Furthermore, Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You post from Our Software to other websites (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.), due to the public nature of such postings.
